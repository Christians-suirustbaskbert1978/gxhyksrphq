OMG just walked out of Last Bullet and I am like… totally shaken. I mean, wow. The theater was way too loud, couldn’t even hear myself think, maybe they turned up the volume to 11? Or it’s just me losing my mind a bit. Anyways, the movie is just a whirlwind of madness and bullet casings, and I think my back’s killing me from sitting through all that chaos!

So, there’s this one scene, GOD, where the protagonist, what’s his name… Jack? Jake?! Yeah, whatever. He literally RUNS across the rooftops like a gazelle, but like if a gazelle had just drank ten energy drinks and was being chased by an espresso machine. The action just doesn’t stop, starts with a bang, ends with… well, a bigger bang. It’s intense, like being stuck in a washing machine full of bricks, in a good way. 

> oh right, the whole love storyline. Total side dish, like the soggy nachos next to your popcorn that you nibble on but kinda wish you hadn’t, more chemistry between my phone and the sticky floor!

I swear, my seat was vibrating more than the phone in my pocket. Is it even normal? Is it the surround sound or just the popcorn grease making me hallucinate! Though idk, maybe I’ll download the movie later, watch the movie again, and see if it’s any different when you’re not distracted by everyone coughing.

Suddenly remembered that car chase! Jeez, it’s not Fast & Furious, it’s more like Fast & Confusing, couldn’t tell who was chasing who. One minute you’re in the city, then BAM, they’re in the desert, like a fever dream set to dubstep. My brain’s still buzzing like, you know, one of those cheap electric toothbrushes.

Just realized I left crumbs everywhere, probably on the person next to me too… oops. But yeah, Last Bullet is kind of like when you drink cheap champagne. You know you’re gonna get a headache, but you just can’t stop guzzling it because it’s too fun to miss.

Uh, better cut this short before I randomly text this to my mom.

```csharp
int bulletCount = 0;
while(true)
{
    if(mindBlown)
    {
        bulletCount++;
        Console.WriteLine(Boom!);
    }
}
```
